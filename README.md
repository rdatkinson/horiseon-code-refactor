## Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description
This project is a code refactor for Horiseon's front page. It was made in mind that the codebase follows accesibility standards so that this marketing agency's suite is optimised for search engines.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This code refactor is used to improve a website's accessibility. <alt> text has been added to every image to aid those using screensavers, and generic <div> tags have been replaced with semantic elements that are specific to the portion of the website, such as <header>, <section>, <article>, etc.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Many thanks to EdX for supplying the source code for this refactor, which can be viewed in the first push into my repo.
